Introduction
Reflection Backend MVP is a Python-based terminal application designed to facilitate deep, introspective reflection for users. Leveraging OpenAI's powerful language models, this tool generates personalized, probing questions that guide users from their current mental state towards an ideal state of self-awareness and clarity.

Features
Introspective Question Generation: Generates deep, meaningful questions based on user input to foster self-reflection.
Automated State Analysis: Utilizes AI/ML models to analyze user reflections and quantify metrics such as anxiety, clarity, motivation, and self-awareness.
Session Logging: Maintains a history of interactions, including user reflections and generated questions, stored locally.
Extensible Architecture: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy transition to a web-based interface in the future.
Secure Configuration: Ensures sensitive information, like API keys, is securely managed through environment variables.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.
Git: Version control system to manage your codebase. Download it from git-scm.com.
Clone the Repository
bash
Copia
git clone https://github.com/scandolo/reflection-backend-mvp.git
cd reflection-backend-mvp
Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash
Copia
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copia
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

bash
Copia
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have pip updated:

bash
Copia
pip install --upgrade pip
Install required packages:

bash
Copia
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt does not exist yet, you can create one with the necessary dependencies based on your project. For example:

bash
Copia
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Ensure your requirements.txt includes at least:

Copia
openai
You can add other dependencies as needed.

Configuration
OpenAI API Key
This application uses OpenAI's API for generating and analyzing text. To use the application, you need to set up your OpenAI API key.

Obtain an API Key:

Sign up or log in to your OpenAI account.
Navigate to the API keys section and generate a new API key.
Set the API Key as an Environment Variable:

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copia
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXyourkeyhere"
On Windows (PowerShell):

powershell
Copia
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXyourkeyhere"
Alternatively, create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add:

env
Copia
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXyourkeyhere
Ensure that .env is included in your .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

Other Environment Variables
If you plan to extend the application with more features or use additional services, consider managing other environment variables similarly.

Usage
Running the Application
Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copia
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

bash
Copia
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Run the application:

bash
Copia
python main.py
Interacting with the Application
Welcome Message: Upon starting, you'll see a welcome message.
Initial Reflection: You'll be prompted to write freely about what brings you here today. You can input multiple paragraphs by pressing Enter and finalize your input by pressing Enter on an empty line or typing /exit to quit.
Generated Question: The AI generates a deep introspective question based on your input.
Your Reflection: Provide your reflection to the generated question using the same multiline input method.
Iteration: The cycle repeats, generating new questions based on your latest reflection until you decide to exit by pressing Enter on an empty line or typing /exit.
Exiting the Application
Type /exit: At any input prompt, type /exit and press Enter to terminate the session immediately.
Empty Input: Press Enter on an empty line to conclude the current reflection and end the session gracefully.

Description of Key Files
main.py: The main script that runs the CLI application, handling user interactions and orchestrating the workflow.
ai/analyzer.py: Contains the analyze_text function that processes user input to extract mental metrics using OpenAI models.
ai/generative_model.py: Manages communication with OpenAI's API, including initializing the SDK and making model calls.
ai/question_generation.py: Implements the logic for generating introspective questions based on current metrics and user context.
utils/data_utils.py: Provides utility functions for loading, saving, and managing session and training data.
data/session_data.json: Stores the history of user interactions within the current session.
data/training_data.json: Accumulates user text and corresponding metrics for potential future model training.
.gitignore: Ensures that sensitive and unnecessary files are not tracked by Git.
